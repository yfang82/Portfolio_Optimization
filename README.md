# Portfolio_Optimization
In this project, I optimized a portfolio of eight S&P500 stocks with Black-Litterman method and generate max sharpe ratio weights as well as the efficient frontier.<br>  

The project was inspired by my MATH 151B course project at UCLA and my recent internship work. In my course project, I solve systems of linear equations that describe simple portfolio optimization situations with numerical method. The project was written in MATLAB and can be seen in [151B_project.pdf](https://github.com/yfang82/Portfolio_Optimization/blob/main/151B_Project.pdf) file.<br> 
 
However, with further exploration in portfolio investment, I realize that in real-world setting, we often have our own perspectives on the movements of the stock prices in our portfolio besides their historical performance. This lead to my interest in Black-Litterman method. <br>  

In [Black_Litterman_method.ipynb](https://github.com/yfang82/Portfolio_Optimization/blob/main/Black_Litterman_method.ipynb), I demonstrated the functions I wrote to implement the Black-Litterman method step-by-step.
